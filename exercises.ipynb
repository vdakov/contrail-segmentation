    "## Introduction: Contail Segmentation\n",
    "The paper \"Few-Shot Contrail Segmentation in Remote Sensing Imagery With Loss Function in Hough Space\" by Junzi et al. focuses on creating an automatic segmentation procedure for contrails when using few data samples by taking advantage of what we know about the problem. In this section, the problem is introduced from the very basics of what a contrails is, to a mathematical formulation of the issue. "

    "*What is a contrail?* \n",
    "\n",
    "Contrails or vapour trails are line-shaped clouds produced by aircraft engine exhaust or changes in air pressure, typically at aircraft cruising altitudes several kilometres/miles above the Earth's surface. (Definition - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrail)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Why does it matter?* \n",
    "\n",
    "The Sun emits solar radiation towards the Earth that the ground traditionally reflects back. However, the formation of the ice crystals in contrails creates a dense enough \"shield\" to reflect a part of them back. This impacts the amount of radiation trapped around the Earth and thus contributes to the temperature. They also have a potential cooling effect on sun rays getting reflected back towards the Sun, though this effect is currently estimated to be smaller.\n"

    "**Satellite Image** \n",
    "\n",
    "Satellite images are a unique form of data. As the name implies, they are taken by a satellite, which leads to charactersitics about it, such as:\n",
    "- **orthogonality**: the perspective of the image is always orthogonal towards the ground \n",
    "- **distance from the Earth**: Depending on the image, and satellite both the distance to the Earth and the resolution of the image is different. \n",
    "    - For this reason, the resolution is measured in terms of actual distance (e.g. A resolution of 30cm means that 30cm of information is encoded per pixel.)\n",
    "    - Common resolutions are 30cm, 1m, 2m. Correspondingly a smaller distance corresponds to higher quality, more expense, harder to get, etc.\n",
    "- **multispectral data**: Sensory information from satellites is more advanced than traditional cameras. They can capture more than just the color spectrum. Each one is a special band (channel in images). Below are listed some examples: \n",
    "    - RGB (Red-Green-Blue): The channels traditional cameras capture, and are blended together to create a final image\n",
    "    - Infrared/Near-Infrared: A channel where some surfaces react differently to - for example, vegetation reacts differently to infrared light. Can reveal new information, not visible to the naked eye.\n",
    "    - Point Clouds (LiDAR): A channel capturing distance to the earth. Used to map out things like elevation via the laser reflecting back. \n",
    "    - And many others, depending on the sensor used ... We will introduce them in this notebook if and as necessary.\n",
